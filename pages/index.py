Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container,
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash
the content.

            The Lepitoa genus of mushrooms can be difficult to label as either edible or poisonious.

            We've devloped a model which can classify Lepitoa mushrooms as
            edible or poisonious with astounding accuracy based on some easily
            observable physical characteristics.
